## Included

This template ships with all the necessary primitives for running in both local development and cloud production environments:
* **Dockerfile**: Optimized multi-stage build that keeps image sizes minimal.
* **Docker Compose**: Pre-configured services for quick local execution.
* **Production configuration**: Safe, production-ready environment defaults.
* **Environment examples**: Documented `.env.example` configurations.
* **CI workflow**: GitHub Actions pre-configured for linting and building.
* **Health endpoint**: Native route to verify server live/ready status.
* **Logging**: Structured logs ready to be collected.
* **Build optimization**: Optimized dependency installation and package caching.

## Local Development

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker and the target framework runtime installed.

### Installation
Clone this repository and set up environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running with Docker
You can spin up the application in a production-ready containerized environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Deploy to Deployxa

Deploying to Deployxa is simple and fast. If you have the Deployxa CLI installed, run:

```bash
deployxa deploy
```

Alternatively, you can link this GitHub repository directly through the Deployxa Dashboard for automated continuous deployment (GitOps).

---

## Project Structure

A predictable layout designed for clarity:
* `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage deployment configuration.
* `docker-compose.yml` - Local container orchestration.
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline template.
* `.env.example` - Standard configuration variables.
* Source files located in modular directory structures.

---

## Production Optimizations

* **Docker layer caching**: Speeds up repeated builds.
* **Optimized dependency installation**: Ensures dev dependencies are omitted in final production images.
* **Smaller production images**: Uses minimal base images (e.g. alpine, debian-slim, distroless).
* **Environment separation**: Clear separation between build-time and run-time environments.
* **Secure defaults**: Runs as non-root user where possible, with strict permission models.
* **Health monitoring**: Integrated `/health` routes for continuous health checks.
* **Production logging**: Clean, structured logging formats.
* **Cloud-native configuration**: Reads settings strictly from environment variables.

---

## AI Development

This project is intentionally designed for AI coding agents:
* **Predictable folder structure**: Standard naming schemes that are easy for LLMs to locate.
* **Readable architecture**: Minimal boilerplate with clear separation of concerns.
* **Documented conventions**: In-line docs and config layouts designed to maximize context efficiency.
* **AI-friendly naming**: Self-documenting functions and variables.
* **Modular organization**: Prevents massive file sizes, making targeted refactoring simpler.

---

## Deployxa Cloud

Deployxa Cloud is a developer-focused platform that manages your container lifecycles seamlessly:
* **Automatic framework detection**: Automatically recognizes and sets up correct runner defaults.
* **Intelligent Docker builds**: Uses remote caching for high-speed deployments.
* **Zero-downtime deployments**: Uses rolling updates with health validation.
* **SSL certificates**: Automatically provisions Let's Encrypt certificates.
* **Custom domains**: Seamless domain mapping.
* **Deployment logs**: Real-time aggregated log streaming.
* **Rollbacks**: One-click rollbacks to any stable history state.
* **Environment variables**: Secure secrets store.
* **Automatic health monitoring**: Automated health monitoring checks.
