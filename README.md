## Health Endpoint

Exposes a JSON payload at `/health`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

---

## Production Optimizations

- **Container Caching**: Docker layer caching speeds up dependency installation.
- **Minimal Image**: Leverages Alpine or Distroless bases where possible.
- **Secure Container Configuration**: Executes as non-root user.

---

## AI Development

Optimized specifically for agents:
- `AGENTS.md` - Context guide.
- `CLAUDE.md` - Command guide.
- `COPILOT.md` - Editor rules.

---

## CI/CD

Validates syntax compiling, execution check, testing logic, and constructs docker build cache on pull requests.
